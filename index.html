        <h2>About Me</h2>
        
        <h3>Hello! My name is Ronny Lara! At the time making this, I'm currently a senior in Thomas A. Edison High School and am currently in the Web and App Development
        program. I have experience in Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Illustrator, Adobe XD, Python, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I'm hoping to pursue a career in the fashion 
        industry. If I had 3 words to describe myself I would say I'm creative, passionate, and hard-working.</h3>
        
        <h3>In this portfolio, you'll be able to see my PopCode Projects and mini-assignments, while seeing my development throughout the year as a coder.<br>
